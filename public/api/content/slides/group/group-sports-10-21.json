    "blurb": "With the clock running down on an uneventful overtime session, forward Justin Gielen nearly had a chance to end the game. Instead, a Yale defender deflected the cross past the endline.\n\nMidfielder Eli Crognale sprinted to the corner to take the set piece as time rapidly ticked under one minute. He floated his cross toward the back post, where defender Johannes Bergmann patiently waited out his chance to spring into the air for a header.\n\nFor the second consecutive game, Bergmann was on the receiving end of a Crognale pass and headed the cross into the back of the net. This time, it was a finish in the 100th minute that gave the No. 25 Terps a 1-0 victory over No. 24 Yale on Monday night at Ludwig Field."
