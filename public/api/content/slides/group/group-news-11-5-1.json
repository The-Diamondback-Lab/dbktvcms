    "blurb": "Trailing 3-2 with 30 seconds to play, coach Sasho Cirovski sold out for the equalizer, sending goalkeeper Niklas Neumann to the box for a corner. Once the Wolverines cleared the chance, forward Jack Hallahan sprinted across midfield and rolled a shot toward the vacant net.\n\nThe ball steadily inched toward the net and trickled across the line to seal Maryland’s fate as the No. 5 seed in the conference tournament, as Michigan erased a second-half deficit to claim the No. 3 seed for itself with a 4-2 victory over the Terps on Sunday evening at Ludwig Field."

    "blurb": "A long ball in the 36th minute found its way past freshman Olivia Hicks, leaving midfielder Meredith Haakenson free on the right wing. The sophomore’s shot to the far post was saved by goalkeeper Erin Seppi, but the rebound leaked out to an unmarked Danielle Wolfe, who slotted home.\n\nThe No. 20 Wolverines would continue to find space on the wing, taking down Maryland, 3-0, in the Big Ten quarterfinals Sunday and cutting short the Terps’ first Big Ten tournament appearance in program history."
