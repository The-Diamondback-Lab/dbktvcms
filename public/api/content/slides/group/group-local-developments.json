    "blurb": "A new Ideal Option branch opened in College Park on Monday, a development state officials say will remove barriers for those seeking addiction treatment in Prince George’s County.\n\nTucked away next to a Long & Foster Real Estate building on Route 1, the center is easy to miss. It focuses on providing medication that — when used correctly — can limit a patient’s opiate withdrawal symptoms and cravings and lessen the effects of opioid molecules in the brain."

    "blurb": "Rufus Perticari knows just a few English words — the three most important being “cheese,” “chicken” and “dog park.”\n\nAt 12 years old, the energetic 80-pound mixed breed dog loves to play and hang out with other dogs, said his owner and “mom,” Rosemary Perticari.\n\nRufus and his “sister” Bella — a Puggle and Jack Russell Terrier mix — get a daily hour-long walk with Perticari’s husband, Perticari said. There aren’t any dog parks within walking distance of their home in North College Park for the dogs to socialize with other canines in the neighborhood, she wrote in an email."
