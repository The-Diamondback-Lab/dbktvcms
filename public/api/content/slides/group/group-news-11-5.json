    "blurb": "The University of Maryland’s Graduate Student Government discussed whether the athletics department should adopt an opt-in model for its graduate student fee on Monday, circling back to the topic almost exactly one year after first pushing for a change.\n\nIn November 2018, the GSG voted overwhelmingly in support of a resolution that called for the university’s athletics department to allow graduate students to forego paying the portion of the fee that goes toward funding student tickets — three-quarters of the then-$136 yearly charge."
