  "blurb": "The University of Maryland’s Confucius Institute occupies a narrow hallway on the fourth floor of Susquehanna Hall. It’s hard to miss — bright red Chinese lanterns hang from the ceiling, and the walls are covered in artwork and photos.\n\n\n\nWhile there are Confucius Institutes across the country, this university’s — which is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year — was the first. It’s a Chinese language and cultural education center that its teachers and students say is helpful to their understanding of the society. But now, it’s also under scrutiny from the federal government and university officials.\n\n\n\n“We are very open,” said the center’s Chinese teacher, Jasmine Liu. “We have nothing to hide.”"
