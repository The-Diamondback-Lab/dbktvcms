  "blurb": "Malikae Dayes stood over a free kick well inside her own territory during Maryland women’s soccer’s match against Michigan State.\n\nThe defender launched the free kick past midfield, finding the head of forward Alyssa Poarch, who flicked the ball forward to meet the run of Loren Sefcik. And Sefcik made her run count, weaving in between two Spartans defenders and shooting the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal.\n\nSefcik’s strike was enough to put her team in the win column for a 1-0 victory, securing Maryland a spot in the Big Ten tournament for the first time in school history."
