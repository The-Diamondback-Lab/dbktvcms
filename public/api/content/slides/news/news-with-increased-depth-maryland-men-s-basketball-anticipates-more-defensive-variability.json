  "blurb": "Trailing by 13 points with 16 minutes to go, Maryland men’s basketball coach Mark Turgeon needed an answer to slow down LSU and erase the deficit in the second round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe margin grew to 15 after Turgeon picked up a technical foul and guard Skylar Mays converted two free throws. And following the free throws, the Terps lined up in a 3-2 zone instead of the man-to-man defense they typically employ.\n\nMaryland used that zone for the remainder of the game, confounding the Tigers on the majority of its remaining possessions."
