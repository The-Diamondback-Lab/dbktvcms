  "blurb": "After a mold outbreak spread through dorms last year, the University of Maryland’s Facilities Management department is installing mold-detection sensors in 10 on-campus buildings.\n\nThe sensors, added under the “MoistureWatch” program, detect temperature and humidity and calculate the point at which water droplets begin to form, said Carlo Colella, this university’s administration and finance vice president.\n\nIf the sensors detect humidity greater than 70 percent, Facilities Management staff receive an alert, and a technician will be sent out to inspect the area, according to an email from university spokesperson Natifia Mullings."
