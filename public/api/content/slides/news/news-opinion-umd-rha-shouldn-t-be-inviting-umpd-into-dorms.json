  "blurb": "Why does the Residence Hall Association think it’s a good idea to bring police into students’ living areas for “calm, non-confrontational” conversations?\n\nA new committee of the RHA, the Residents and Police Committee, is planning to host guest speaker events and “educational programs” in dorms to improve relationships between University of Maryland Police and the larger student population. \n\nThe committee will bring cops into students’ spaces without crime-related cause. But at a university that touts an undergraduate population of more than 40 percent minority students, this seems inappropriate — and absolutely should not occur."
