  "blurb": "When Gov. Larry Hogan visited College Park Academy in January, Dylan Burns remembered feeling frustrated. As Hogan arrived to discuss a proposed boost in funding for charter school construction, Burns — then a student at the academy — recalled a poster covering up a hole in the school’s drywall. It was a problem that had become somewhat commonplace in the building, which was built in 2017.\n\nBurns said he wishes he had approached Hogan, who has praised the academy as the future for charter schools in the state.\n\n“It was being touted as this big new shiny toy, but then you press the button and the toy breaks,” said Burns, who graduated in the spring."
