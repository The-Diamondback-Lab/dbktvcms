  "blurb": "After years of business, the future of the Downtown College Park Farmers Market is unclear.\n\nEarlier this month, the farmers market — which typically lasts from April through November — announced it would be wrapping up a month ahead of schedule due to low customer turnout. Julie Beavers, the market’s manager, says it might not return next year.\n\nOver the last few years, the market has seen a steady decline in vendor and customer attendance, Beavers said. And in the last few months, the market had only two vendors — a prepared-food Thai restaurant and a gluten-free bread vendor, she said."
