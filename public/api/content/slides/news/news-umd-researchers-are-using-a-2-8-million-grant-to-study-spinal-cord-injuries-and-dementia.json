  "blurb": "A team of University of Maryland and University of Maryland, Baltimore researchers is investigating the connection between dementia and spinal cord injuries with the help of a $2.8 million dollar grant awarded earlier this month from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe project — a collaborative effort between the university’s bioengineering lab and the University of Maryland medical school, which is housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore — aims to examine a link between spinal cord injuries and degeneration in the brain.\n\nThe possible link has to do with particles called extracellular vesicles, which cells use for communication, said Steven Jay, an associate bioengineering professor working on the study."
