  "blurb": "Even then, as the tears welled up in his eyes and began to roll down his cheeks, Jalen Smith was no quitter.\n\n\n\nHe hated losing, so he cried. And when facing his father at his local recreational center gym, losing came often, an expected outcome for an elementary schooler facing someone twice his height in 1-on-1 basketball. But he’d soon dry those eyes and return to the floor, ready for another go, hoping for a different result.\n\n\n\nSmith says he’s changed; he’s no longer a “cry baby” and he certainly doesn’t lose at the rate he once did when facing his father. But that hatred of losing — that’s something he’ll never shake. It’s ingrained in him, an aversion so powerful he tries to avoid it all costs — no matter if he’s at the rec center or inside Xfinity Center — and sometimes those feelings still sneak up on him."
