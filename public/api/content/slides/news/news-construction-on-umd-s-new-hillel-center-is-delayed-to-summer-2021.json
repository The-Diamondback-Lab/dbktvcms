  "blurb": "Construction on the new University of Maryland Hillel Center has been delayed to summer 2021, two years after it was originally supposed to break ground.\n\nThe delay is a result of the time it took to design the building, get plans approved and secure funding for construction, said Elan Burman, Maryland Hillel’s assistant director.\n\nThe Ben and Esther Rosenbloom Hillel Center for Jewish Life was designed collaboratively, with student input, Burman said — a process that took more time than originally expected.\n\n“This really is a building for students, by students,” he said."
