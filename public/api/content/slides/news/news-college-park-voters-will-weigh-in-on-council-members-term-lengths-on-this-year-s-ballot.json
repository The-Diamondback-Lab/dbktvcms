  "blurb": "In this year’s city council election, College Park voters will be asked to weigh in on potential changes to mayoral and council member term lengths.\n\nThe council agreed in July to add two questions to the election’s ballot: one asking whether constituents think terms should be extended from two years to four and another asking whether elections should be staggered if terms are lengthened.\n\nThe council decided to add the questions to the ballot after it received a report in May on the topic from the Charter Review Committee — a 10-member committee created to evaluate the pros and cons of longer term lengths."
