  "blurb": "After scoring her second goal in Sunday’s matchup against Indiana, Maryland field hockey forward Mayv Clune jogged off the pitch and into the arms of her teammates, who greeted her with a vociferous reception as soon as the ball rattled the back of the cage.\n\n\n\nBy that time, many of Maryland’s starters had given way to substitutes like Clune and forward Lizzy Dessoye. But the heightened intensity remained, pushing the Terps to build on what was already a crooked scoreline.\n\n\n\nSo they did."
