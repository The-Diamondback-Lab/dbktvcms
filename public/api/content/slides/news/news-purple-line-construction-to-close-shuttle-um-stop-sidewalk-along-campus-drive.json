  "blurb": "Starting this month, construction for the Purple Line will cause two significant closures along Campus Drive at the University of Maryland, according to a campuswide email sent Thursday.\n\nOn or around Nov. 3, the Campus Drive stop at 50th Avenue for the #104 College Park Metro Shuttle-UM route and the portion of the sidewalk along Campus Drive and under the railroad tracks between Paint Branch Trail and River Road, will shut down.\n\nAccording to the email, sent from Purple Line UMD, Shuttle-UM riders should use stop #36469 on River Road instead of the one on Campus Drive, and pedestrians and cyclists should take a detour through the Old Town neighborhood when entering or exiting the metro station."
