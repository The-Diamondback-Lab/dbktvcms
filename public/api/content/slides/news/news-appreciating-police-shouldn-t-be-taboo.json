  "blurb": "New research into police brutality has revealed that fatal police violence is the sixth-leading cause of death among 25 to 29-year-old men in every racial group. And inherent racism toward black males — who are 2.5 times more susceptible than their white counterparts to fatal police violence — has become even more evident.\n\nNaturally, these statistics, alongside a villainous portrayal in the media, have led to an unfavorable view of police officers. Recently, a wooden flag with a single blue stripe that was gifted to the Montgomery County police station was banned by a county executive because it was deemed “divisive.” The inclusion of the blue line has been labeled by some as a slight against Black Lives Matter by apparently conveying the opposing message, Blue Lives Matter.\n\nThis is a bit of an overreaction."
