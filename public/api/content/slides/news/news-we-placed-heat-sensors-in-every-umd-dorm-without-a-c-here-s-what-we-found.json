  "blurb": "It’s no secret that living in a dorm without air conditioning can be rough. Last year, the Department of Resident Life opened up multipurpose and study rooms with air conditioning so students living in dorms without cooling systems could sleep and study in more hospitable conditions.\n\nBut just how hot does it get in dorms without air conditioning? Last month, The Diamondback decided to find out.\n\nReporters placed sensors that measure heat and humidity in each of the university’s dorms without air conditioning from Sept. 6-14. From the collected data, The Diamondback analyzed hourly and daily temperatures, as well as averages of the “heat index” — a measure calculated from heat and humidity that describes what the environment’s temperature feels like."
