  "blurb": "As Michigan forward Jack Hallahan dribbled uninhibited toward the 18-yard box, Maryland men’s soccer coach Sasho Cirovski yelled from the sideline, “It’s too easy.”\n\nHallahan pushed a pass out to the wing for Nebojsa Popovic’s cross, which was redirected just high in the 50th minute of the Wolverines’ 4-2 victory on Sunday at Ludwig Field.\n\nThe Terps’ defense could breathe a sigh of relief in what was then a 2-2 game, but Michigan’s go-ahead strike seemed imminent with the time and space Maryland afforded."
